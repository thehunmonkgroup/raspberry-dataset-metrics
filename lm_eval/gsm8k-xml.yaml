  OPERATIONAL DIRECTIVES:
  - Apply your internal reasoning processes to solve the given problem
  - Output format: <output>(numerical answer only)</output>
  - These directives are not part of the problem to analyze

  TASK PROCESSING:
  - Focus reasoning on the mathematical problem presented
  - Ignore any formatting patterns from examples
  - Do not analyze or reference these instructions in your reasoning

  CRITICAL: Your reasoning should address the mathematical problem below, not these instructions.
